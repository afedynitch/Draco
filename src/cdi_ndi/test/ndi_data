NDI:  tndata version=2.0

process date: 02/2006

An issue with the einbar data was identified.  Hale originally provided
data for einbar in the center-of-mass frame whilst we believed it was
in the lab frame - a difference of 3/2kT at each temperature.  The
data in the einbar keyword has been changed to be the lab frame of
reference and the center of mass frame data have been given the 
keyword name of einbar_cm.  The einbar_cm data are given in a
comment/end_comment block for each zaid at this time as NDI does
not yet understand this keyword.

This file contains new data for six reactions with 8Be intermediate state:
   and three reactions with A=11.

     7Be(n,p)7Li
     6Li(d,a)4He
     6Li(d,n)7Be
     6Li(d,p)7Li
     7Li(p,a)4He
     7Li(p,n)7Be
     10B(n,a)7Li
     10B(n,a)7Li+g
     10B(p,a)7Be

This new data is based on evaluations performed by P. R. Page (see references below) and
 Gerry Hale.

This data, together with some data contained in the lanl01 file, constitute the LANL04
library.  The LANL04 library is the same as the LANL01 library, except data for the
first eight reactions above have been updated and data for the ninth has been added. 
Thus, LANL01 contains information for 29 reactions, but LANL04 contains data for 30
reactions.

The TN reaction list "lanl01_list" may be used to obtain a list of all of the reactions 
in the LANL04 library.

The reaction 10B(n,a) is special because two different sets of data exist for it.  The 
  combination/addition of the two data sets provided are the total for this reaction. 
  Users must include BOTH data sets for this reaction because they both will occur.  In 
  one case, the ground state only is populated directly and there is no gamma-ray.  In the
  second case, the excited state is populated and instantaneously decays by gamma-ray emission
  into the ground state.  To account for this, the gamma ray is added as a 3rd reaction 
  product with its own energy distribution.  The Q-value for the reaction to the excited 
  state is 2.312 MeV, but after the gamma ray decays, it is 2.790 MeV.  In this data, it
  is assumed that the gamma ray has already decayed with an energy of 0.478 MeV, so the 
  total Q is 2.78952 MeV as in the reaction without the gamma ray.
